## Introduction
IronBlood Siege is a mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord that enhances the siege battle experience. In vanilla siege battles, attacking troops often retreat mindlessly, sometimes even when they vastly outnumber the defenders, leading to poor siege experience for players seeking challenging gameplay. This mod effectively prevents troops from retreating unnecessarily and dynamically adjusts morale values to ensure siege sustainability.


## Usage Tips
- The mod automatically takes effect during siege battles
- Settings can be adjusted anytime through the ESC menu during battle
- In multi-mod setups, recommend loading this mod last
